The goal of this package is to wrap [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) to make it super easy to use with [Factory Muffin](https://github.com/thephpleague/factory-muffin).

Note that this library does not actually require Factory Muffin in order to work, so may be used else where too. The whole point of this library is to wrap Faker in closures so the actual generation can be executed at a later point.


## Installing

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.4+ and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.
